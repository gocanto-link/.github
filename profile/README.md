  <i>Movement. Transformation. Shared Knowledge.</i>
</p>

Welcome! We are a collective dedicated to sharing code, knowledge, and fostering growth. Our work is inspired by the Aztec concept of **Ollin** ("movement" or "motion")—a guiding force for transformation, awareness, and wholehearted living.

Our repositories are a reflection of this philosophy. We believe that code, like life, is in constant motion.

## Our Guiding Principle

In Aztec tradition, **Ollin** means “movement” or “motion,” embodying transformation, heart, life, and the calendar’s purified spirit-day. But for us, it goes deeper—it speaks to the same gentle momentum at the heart of Zen, where each breath and each step is a flowing wave of presence.

For anyone on the path of self-discovery, Ollin becomes a guide: it reminds us to move with intention, stay grounded in the here and now, and welcome life’s shifts as chances to grow.

Just as Zen teaches us to let thoughts pass like clouds, Ollin’s energy urges us to embrace change—transforming every action into a moment of awareness, renewal, and wholehearted living.

Our spelling, **Oullin**, is a deliberate twist. It's our daily nudge to stay present, move with purpose, and welcome every change as part of our shared journey.

## What You'll Find Here

This organisation is a living library of our explorations. We share code and knowledge to help ourselves and others grow. You'll find:

* 🌱 **Learning Projects:** Repositories designed to explore new technologies, patterns, and concepts.
* 🛠️ **Tools & Utilities:** Practical code meant to be shared, adapted, and improved upon.
* 📚 **Knowledge Bases:** Curated lists, articles, and guides on topics we're passionate about.
* 💡 **Experiments:** Open explorations and ideas-in-progress. We embrace the process, not just the final product.

## Join the Movement

This is not just a collection of code; it's an invitation to participate. We are always open to collaboration, discussion, and new perspectives.

* 👋 **Start a Discussion:** Have a question or an idea? Feel free to open an issue or start a discussion in the relevant repository.
