# Profile

Welcome! We are a collective dedicated to sharing code, knowledge, and fostering growth. Our work is inspired by the Aztec concept of Ollin ("movement" or "motion")—a guiding force for transformation, awareness, and wholehearted living.

...Ollin’s energy urges us to embrace change—transforming every action into a moment of awareness, renewal, and wholehearted living.

Our spelling, Oullin, is a deliberate twist. It's our daily nudge to stay present, move with purpose, and welcome every change as part of our shared journey.
